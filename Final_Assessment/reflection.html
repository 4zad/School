                Responsive design is in a sense an active design. This means, it is a design that changes based on its environment. In
                the case of web development, especially front-end development and user interface design, responsive design is the
                designing a website such that the user interface and design of the website changes based on the qualities of the device
                it is viewed on. These qualities include the screen resolution, screen ratio, platform and even method of use of the
                device. This is done to improve the overall experience of the website on all various types of devices. For example, if a
                website is designed to have three pictures in a single row, on a phone it may reduce the size of the images to an
                extremely small size to have them fit in the width of the phone’s screen. However, if the website was made using
                responsive design, when you view it on a slim screen like a phone it may change the images’ positions so that they line
                up vertically, in a column, rather than horizontally, in a row.
            </p><br>

                Responsive design also heavily influences web technologies. They are both related in the sense that responsive design is
                so important, especially now that there are such a vast variety of devices that can access the web, that web
                technologies must include the ability to create responsively designed web applications. Over the years web technologies
                have evolved and come to be what they are today due to our need for responsive design when creating web applications.
                For example, CSS has a lot of properties and units of measurements that are created solely for the purpose of the
                ability to implement responsive design. For example, the viewport width and viewport height unit, the min/max width and 
                min/max height properties and media queries, which all define how a webpage changes according to its screen size and 
                resolution.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                During my research on responsive design and throughout this course, I learned that building responsive web applications
                means, understanding the various screen ratios and screen orientations of devices. You have to consider how you will
                redesign, realign, and/or re-orient parts of a web application to fit on a wide screen, square screen, and thin/tall
                screens. This means a lot of planning goes into creating a responsive website. I also learned that certain frameworks,
                like bootstrap, also define the media query breakpoints, which help to represent an assortment of common device display
                sizes. This makes it easier to make responsive web applications, that are compatible with an assortment of applications.
                This also incentivises using media queries as it is a simple and easy way of making a web application responsive.
            </p><br>

                Other things I learned in this course include utilizing JavaScript to read and write from and to an HTML document, to
                style a webpage, to efficiently place the components of a webpage, good practices of writing HTML (adding values to
                label tags for the impaired) and even various resources that are available on the internet that can be used when
                creating webpages (Font Awesome, Google Fonts, etc.). The various assignments that the course offered involved
                implementing a lot of what I had learned and helped me to learn a lot of minor things that can only be learned through
                experience. I think they were a great part of the course. I do wish the tests were heavier on theory and concepts,
                rather than actual code (As it is really hard to write code on blackboard). Overall, this course has taught me so much
                and has opened a new world of web development for me. I really enjoyed it more than I thought I would have. So much so,
                that I am considering this field of study for my future career, inshAllah.
